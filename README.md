# TV Show Market Research: Superhero Genre (Black Cat Project)

This project explores what makes superhero TV shows and movies (especially female-led) successful, using data from TMDb and social media. The goal is to inform the creative and marketing process for a mock TV show based on the superhero Black Cat.

## Project Structure

- `data/` — Raw and processed data files
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization
- `src/` — Python scripts for data collection and wrangling
- `reports/` — Generated figures and outputs for presentations
- `requirements.txt` — List of Python dependencies
- `.env` — Store your TMDb API key (not committed)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and open in Codespaces or locally.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your TMDb API key:
   ```
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start exploring in `notebooks/` or run scripts in `src/`.

## Goals
- Analyze trends and performance of superhero TV shows/movies
- Focus on female-led and ensemble superhero content
- Use data to inform creative and marketing decisions
- Visualize findings for a nontechnical audience
