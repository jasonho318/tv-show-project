With his short frame and at almost 50, Alain is a physical phenomenon capable of hoisting his body with only one finger despite a major disability due to a fall in 1982. Paradoxically, it is after that accident that he developed his style of climbing using only his bare hands and without any security.  Today, with more than 100 towers climbed, as many arrests and several stays in prison, Alain is a legend. But who’s the man behind the climber? What motivates him? Find out in this portrait full of breathtaking footage.",

    "overview": "A woman is being sexually assaulted by a pair of thugs, when out of the fog appear the High Heeled Cats – a trio of avenging angels, masked and dressed in black. These beautiful vigilantes make a living running a coffee shop by day, and kicking misogynist criminals in the balls by night. Their boss is an elderly lady offering a payback service to women who have been mistreated by men. The cops can’t be seen to allow this kind of behavior, but they are increasingly frustrated with the lack of clues that might lead to the identity of the trio – despite the fact that the two detectives on the case visit the coffee shop daily, to flirt with and grope the waitresses, and drink the occasional cup of coffee. The high heeled honeys eventually bite off more than they can chew when they get on the bad side of a ruthless gangster, who sets a creepy assassin on their trail.",

The film's stunt coordinator discusses Jackman's commitment to bulking up-drinking a dozen egg whites a day and going on an intense fitness regime-and director Gavin Hood explains Wolverine's degree of self-loathing about his own nature. We also see some of the design work that went into the film, including the sculpting of young Logan's bone claws and the re-invention of the adamantium tank. Jackman comes off personable as always, and it's clear that he really loves this role.",
